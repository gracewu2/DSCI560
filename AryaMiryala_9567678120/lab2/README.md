## Project Overview
This project serves as the initial data exploration phase for a **Marathon Training AI Agent**. The goal is to build an intelligent assistant that can help runners with:
1.  **Race Rules:** Parsing official PDF rulebooks to answer logistical questions.
2.  **Historical Analysis:** Analyzing CSV data of past race winners to determine pacing and trends.
3.  **General Knowledge:** Scraping web data to provide training and nutrition advice.

This repository contains the `data_exploration.py` script, which demonstrates the ability to ingest, clean, and analyze these three distinct data formats.
